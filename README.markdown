# Trippy colors (GPU version)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/paris-urquhart/pen/vYxvQBL](https://codepen.io/paris-urquhart/pen/vYxvQBL).

Perlin noise + random numbers creates quite some trippy effects! :D

This is 2 of the 2 pens i'm making, to show the difference between running perlin noise calculation over the CPU (http://codepen.io/Fahscinate/pen/LWNbKP) and over the GPU (this one).

Perlin noise algorithms are from https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise
